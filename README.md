Just Rock Paper Scissors!

This project took me way longer than I had hoped! This was super humbling.
I'm really grateful for the Odin Project.
I feel like I've learned nothing from the programming courses I've
taken in university.

It took me 19 25min pomodoros or around 8 hours of dedicated focus to get this to work.

I really learned a lot about the DOM and was forced to apply my knowledge
of certain properties that I didn't even think were necessary to learn/use.

I put everything into functions and feel that I did the best I could to
cleanup/refactor my code for this project.

I listened to "Howling" by Lupus Nocte through most of this project. It's such a
fun tune!
